          | Our mission at MySQUAR is to connect the people of Myanmar through consumer technology. We want to facilitate the creation
          | and sharing of information and ideas through a broad, accessible and authentic online experience.
        p
          | Providing a balance between free expression and the needs of a diverse public are important to ensure a happy community.
          | With that in mind, we’ve created the following community standards to help shape what sort of content is acceptable
          | and what content may be reported or removed.
        h3 Violence, Bullying and Threats
        p
          | We aim to keep our channels free of any online violence, bullying, threats or abuse on our platform. We will take action
          | to report or remove any behaviour that we perceive to be endorsing physical harm, or a threat to public safety.
        h3 Hate Speech
        p
          | We strive to make a distinction between satire and humorous expression and serious speech. Attacks based on race, ethnicity,
          | national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities or medical conditions may be reported or removed.
        h3 Graphic Content
        p
          | We expect that people who share content on our platform should do so in a responsible manner. If inappropriate content
          | is shared in a public manner it may be reported or removed. This includes both graphic violence and content of a
          | pornographic nature.
        h3 Intellectual Property
        p
          | Before sharing content on our platforms, please be sure you have the rights to do so. Please respect copyrights, trademarks,
          | and other legal rights.
        h3 Phishing and Spam
        p
          | We ask that you refrain from contacting users for commercial purposes without prior consent.
        h3 Security
        p
          | Privacy and security is something we take seriously. We work to keep your information secure from outsiders.
        h3 Reporting Abuse
        p
          | If you see something on any MySQUAR product that you believe violates these standards, you should report it to us.
          | Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. Because
          | of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you without
          | meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer the ability to block users.
